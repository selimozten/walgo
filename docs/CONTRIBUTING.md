### Pull Request Guidelines

Your PR should:

- **Include a clear description** of what the change does
- **Provide testing instructions** for reviewers
- **Update relevant documentation**
- **Pass all existing tests**
- **Follow the established coding style**

## Coding Standards

### Go Code Style
- Follow standard Go formatting: `go fmt ./...`
- Use `golangci-lint` for linting: `golangci-lint run`
- Write clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized

### File Organization
- Place new commands in `cmd/` directory
- Internal packages go in `internal/`
- Tests should be in `*_test.go` files
- Integration tests go in the `tests/` directory

### Commit Messages
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Include more details in the body if needed
- Reference issues and PRs where relevant

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Add integration tests for new commands
- Test the CLI interface end-to-end
- Include tests for error conditions

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run specific test
go test ./internal/config -v

# Run integration tests
go test -tags=integration ./tests/...
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22 or later
- Hugo (latest version)

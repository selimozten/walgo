# Welcome to My Decentralized Blog!

This is my first post on my new blog deployed to Walrus Sites - the decentralized web storage network.

## Why Decentralized?

- **Censorship resistant**: No single point of failure
- **Always available**: Distributed across multiple nodes
- **Permanent storage**: Content preserved for specified epochs
- **Cost effective**: Pay only for the storage epochs you need

## What's Next?

I'll be posting about:
- Web3 technologies
- Hugo static site generation
- Decentralized storage solutions
- And much more!

Stay tuned for more content!
